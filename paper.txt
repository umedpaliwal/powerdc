Abstract: Timely grid access for the large volume of renewable energy (RE) projects awaiting in
the queue has become a significant bottleneck for meeting growing electricity demand with
low-cost clean energy. However, recent cost declines in renewables combined with incentives
from the Inflation Reduction Act enable the siting of low-cost renewables near existing
interconnection. Here, we utilize high-resolution satellite imagery to estimate the renewable
energy (RE) potential within a 6x6 mile buffer zone around existing fossil power plants in the
United States (US). We find that it is technically feasible and economically viable for existing
fossil power plants to share their grid access with around 800 GW of renewable energy (RE)
currently, and around 1,000 GW by 2030 as the economics of RE continue to improve, potentially
nearly doubling the US generation capacity and significantly reducing the cost of electricity. We
argue that a significant opportunity likely exists for large-scale RE and storage deployment by
sharing grid access with about 250 GW of RE plants that currently utilize their grid connections
less than 70% of the time, warranting further evaluation. By improving the utilization of existing
infrastructure, this strategy bypasses traditional renewable integration challenges such as the
interconnection queue backlog while also generating additional revenue for power plant owners
and tax revenue for local communities. Despite limited commercial interest today, with
appropriate policy and regulatory support, this can be a mainstream strategy for integrating
clean electricity sources at speed and scale.

Introduction
The power system has emerged as the major bottleneck to meeting growing electricity demand
with low-cost clean energy. Demand for electricity - and in particular, clean electricity - has
soared, driven by the electrification of various sectors, the rise of data centers for artificial
intelligence (AI), and booming investment into clean tech manufacturing. Simultaneously, clean
energy is increasingly economically viable due to dramatic declines in the costs of renewables
and battery storage coupled with incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): for example,
the prices of utility-scale solar Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) reached a record-low of
$24/MWh for projects beginning commercial operation in 2023 while nearly half of the new
PPAs signed in 2023 qualify for the energy community tax credit and have achieved similar
prices (1). Yet in the United States (US) today, nearly 1,500 GW of solar and wind plus over
1,000 GW of battery storage remain stalled in the interconnection queue, where projects
seeking to connect to the grid wait while they undergo a series of system impact studies that
analyze if, and which, network upgrades are needed before the project can be brought online
(2). The active capacity in the queue has been growing, translating to increased interconnection
wait times: while the typical duration from interconnection request to commercial operation
averaged less than two years for projects built in 2000-2007, projects built in 2023 have a
median wait of five years (2). Challenges associated with executing the transmission upgrades
exacerbate the issue, with lead times for transformers recently surging to two to four years (3).
These grid bottlenecks are translating to a lagging rate of renewable energy (RE) deployment,
which needs to be accelerated if projected load growth is to be delivered at the lowest cost. At
the national level as shown in Figure 1, even in the optimistic case in which the current average
rate of 30 GW/year is doubled (e.g. through streamlined interconnection processes),
maintaining this pace until 2035 will likely fall short by ~1000 GW compared to the least-cost
projections by several major studies. Some predictions indicate that AI data centers alone could
require up to 500 TWh of electricity by 2030, absorbing almost all new RE additions assuming
deployment continues at its current pace (4). In the absence of cleaner alternatives, this
generation shortfall would have to be met by fossil generation, with corresponding emissions
and costs. In contrast, other global players like China are deploying RE at rates ten times higher
than the US, reaping the benefits of low-cost energy for their consumers and industries. While
2024 is projected to be a record-setting year with 45 GW of RE commencing commercial
operation, additional efforts are required to fill the gap (5).
PJM’s resource adequacy risk
The Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the US by
customers served, faces significant challenges in maintaining resource adequacy. Load forecasts show
demand growth averaging 1.4% per year for the PJM footprint and up to 7% for zones with data centers
clusters, signifying unprecedented growth in electricity demand. Yet simultaneously, 40 GW of fossil
generation capacity (21% of PJM’s currently installed capacity) may retire by 2030 and the rate of new
capacity additions and in particular RE and battery storage has lagged (6). This asymmetrical pace in
which resource retirements and load growth exceed the pace of new entry may translate into a potential
capacity shortfall of nearly 4 GW by 2029, escalating to over 8 GW by 2034 if current trends hold. This
underscores the urgent need for accelerating the integration of new resources and in particular RE and
battery storage solutions to meet future demand and support grid reliability.
Figure 1: The US is headed toward a significant shortfall in clean energy, projected to reach around 1,000 GW by
2035 even with a doubling of the current deployment rate. Actual values for 2015-2023, projected values for
2024, extrapolated values for 2024-2035, and modeled values for 2030 & 2035 from major studies (7-9).
A promising strategy for accelerating renewable energy deployment is to leverage existing grid
infrastructure through interconnection sharing. Also known as surplus interconnection,
repowering, cable pooling, or hybridization, it would involve the expedited addition of RE
and/or battery storage capacity at or in close proximity to existing power plants, allowing the RE
capacity to share the existing grid access point without surpassing the original interconnection
capacity limits - as shown in Figure 2. The strategy would maximize the utilization of existing
grid assets and effectively bypass the lengthy conventional interconnection queue process.
Policy paves the way forward for interconnection sharing at existing facilities under Order 845
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which requires transmission providers
to establish an expedited process for interconnection customers to utilize or transfer surplus
interconnection service at existing facilities. While the subsequent analysis focuses on adding RE
to operational fossil plants through surplus interconnection, the basic premise of leveraging
existing grid infrastructure would likewise be valuable for retiring power plants through
generator replacement, enabling new, low-cost renewable and/or battery storage capacity to be
added at the site of retiring power plants. A prime candidate for this is the nearly 70 GW of
coal-fired capacity that is scheduled for retirement between 2024 and 2030 (10).
Figure 2: Schematic of renewables and/or storage sharing the interconnection with existing fossil power plants.
The Growing Challenge of AI Infrastructure Energy Demand
The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence infrastructure is creating unprecedented demands on the United
States power grid. Morgan Stanley Research projects U.S. data center power consumption will escalate from 160
terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023 to 337 TWh by 2027, with AI-specific power demand growing at a 105% compound
annual growth rate (4). By 2030, data center power consumption could reach 450 TWh, constituting 10.6% of
total U.S. grid capacity. According to EPRI, U.S. data centers would increase from approximately 4% of total U.S.
electricity consumption today to between 4.6% and 9% by 2030 (11).
Major technology companies are pursuing strategic partnerships with nuclear facilities to secure reliable clean
power. Microsoft is funding the restoration of decommissioned nuclear facilities, while Amazon has acquired a
nuclear-powered data center near the currently operating Susquehanna Nuclear facility. However, when large
technology companies secure substantial portions of existing clean energy capacity, it reduces availability for
other grid users, potentially increasing reliance on fossil fuels elsewhere if clean energy development cannot
match growing demand.
Interconnection sharing offers a solution by enabling rapid integration of renewables through existing
interconnection points. By reducing project deployment times from 4-5 years to 1-2 years, this approach enables
faster expansion of cheap clean energy capacity rather than redistribution of existing resources—essential for
maintaining U.S. technological leadership in artificial intelligence development.
Clean energy cost declines and IRA incentives have substantially augmented the economic
viability of the opportunity. Three factors in particular stand out in the IRA: generous Production
Tax Credits (PTCs) for RE generation; an enhanced 10% bonus on PTC as well as an Investment
Tax Credit (ITC) for RE projects located in energy communities; and an Energy Infrastructure
Reinvestment (EIR) program that offers low-cost loans for communities to repower or repurpose
existing energy infrastructure (12). These factors increase the likelihood that the levelized cost
of RE near existing fossil power plants will be lower than the existing plants’ operating costs,
enabling plant owners to - after considering operational constraints like ramp rates - back down
their fossil plants and send out clean power during RE generation hours, reducing the all-in cost
of delivering power at the point of interconnection. This is reinforced by Figure 3, which shows
how both renewables’ Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) as well as Power Purchase Agreements
(PPAs) prices have declined in recent years, reaching a generation-weighted $30.5/MWh with
tax credits and $24/MWh for projects beginning commercial operation in 2023, respectively (1).
This is either competitive or below the median variable costs of conventional generation
sources - and renewable costs are projected to continue to decline.

opportunity to cost-effectively swap their generation with clean energy. Historical solar LCOE and PPA prices from
(1), projected solar and wind LCOE from (13). Historical LCOE and PPA prices reflect the year in which commercial
operation commenced.
Although the idea of interconnection sharing has been discussed for years, it was perceived as a
limited case-by-case opportunity that required the highest RE resource quality (14-18).
However, the falling costs of RE combined with recent policy developments have sparked new
commercial interest, particularly in integrating solar at existing fossil power plants; these
projects indicate that interconnection sharing offers significant advantages with regards to
faster deployment, avoided interconnection costs, improved infrastructure utilization, retaining
tax revenue and jobs in host communities, new revenue streams through portfolio
diversification for fossil asset owners, and lowering electricity costs and thus consumer bills.
Overall, the strategy presents a promising, unifying pathway for accelerating clean energy
deployment by engaging stakeholders who might otherwise resist the energy transition by
aligning their economic interests with decarbonization efforts. Here, we build upon previous
studies with the latest data to quantify the opportunity of interconnection sharing, which with
appropriate policy and regulatory support, could be a mainstream strategy for integrating clean
electricity sources at speed and scale.
Finding #1: The total hyperlocal RE potential around US fossil power plants is over 15,400 GW
To quantify the potential for leveraging the interconnection of existing fossil plants, we first
estimate the total resource potential of solar and wind in close proximity to existing fossil power
plants. While previous studies assessed the RE potential over a large radius, i.e. 45 km (18), in
order to robustly make the case there is sufficient local RE that can share existing
interconnection points, we use a considerably tighter i.e. 10x10 km (6x6 mile) square buffer
zone around the existing power plant, reflective of commercial activity in the US today. In
practice, this means the maximum spur line distance between the RE facility and the existing
point of interconnection would be less than 10 km (6 miles), which also minimizes the
complexity associated with the permitting of the spur line. Within each buffer zone, we assess
the potential for RE development of each 30x30m (100x100 ft) parcel of land through
high-resolution satellite imagery and applying several exclusion criteria (for more details, see
Methods). We find that the total hyperlocal RE potential within the 10x10 km buffer zone near
the 1400 existing fossil power plants in the contiguous US is over 15,400 GW.
Estimating Deployable Hyper-Local Renewable Energy Potential by Considering Multiple Exclusions
Renewable energy (RE) deployment is increasingly facing siting challenges. To arrive at a realistic estimate of
deployable potential, we sought to replicate the criteria that RE project developers typically use to select
suitable land for deployment considering these challenges. We applied 50+ exclusion criterias, grouped into four
main categories:
1. Physical Site Characteristics: We excluded areas based on incompatible land cover types (including
urban development, water bodies, forests, and mangroves), excessive slope gradients, and elevation
constraints that would preclude RE development.
2. Protected Areas: All locations with environmental protection status or development restrictions were
removed from consideration.
3. Infrastructure Density: We eliminated sites where built infrastructure exceeded 30% of the land area
within a 6-mile (10x10 km) buffer zone around existing power plants, recognizing that dense
development patterns typically preclude cost-effective RE deployment.
4. Regulatory Restrictions: Areas subject to local ordinances prohibiting wind development were excluded
from wind potential calculations, reflecting current regulatory limitations.
Out of a total of 1,404 power plants, 155 plants are entirely excluded due to having more than 30% built
infrastructure within a six-mile buffer zone, affecting plants such as peaker plants in the Los Angeles Basin. We
also excluded areas where local prohibitions prevent RE deployment, impacting approximately 5% of the plants
in our analysis.
After applying these exclusions, of the remaining 1220 plants, 1099 have renewable potential that exceeds their
interconnection capacity by more than five times, indicating significant opportunities to maximize the utilization
of interconnections through increased renewable deployment.
From this total, we next evaluate the technical and economic viability to quantify the actionable
RE integration potential as well as the RE needs for a least-cost power system, as shown in
Figure 4.
Figure 4: Summary of methods and results.
Finding #2: For over 75% of existing fossil power plants, the RE LCOE is lower than the plants’
variable costs today
Despite this tremendous potential, the RE integration potential at existing interconnection is
likely significantly lower as a result of several constraints which we subsequently apply. For one,
for interconnection sharing to be economically viable, crossover must have occurred - that is,
the LCOE of local RE must be lower than the variable cost (VC) of the existing fossil power
plants, particularly those that operate at high capacity factors. To calculate the VC, we take the
fuel cost (calculated based on the 7-year historical average of state-level costs for coal or gas,
from the Energy Information Administration (EIA)) plus variable operation and maintenance
(O&M) costs (from ReEDS) (for more details, see Methods). This analysis is performed on a unit
level for the 4600 individual units at the 1400 existing fossil power plants in the US, recognizing
that fuel type and prime mover may not necessarily be homogeneous across all units within the
same plant.
As shown in Figure 5a-b, we find that solar crossover has arrived for 75% of the 700 GW of
existing fossil interconnection and wind crossover has arrived for 80% of the 700 GW of existing
fossil interconnection in the US today. Crossover is projected to arrive by 2030 for nearly all
existing fossil power plants as RE costs decline further, as shown in Figure 5c-d. The cumulative
interconnection capacity of existing fossil power plants that has crossed over can be seen on an
annual basis in Figure 5e-f, indicating that an average of 8 GW of wind and 30 GW of solar
crosses over per year until 2030. This economic crossover leads to a fundamental shift in the
conventional operational paradigm: once the local RE LCOE falls below the VC of fossil
generation, renewable generation should be prioritized when available, accounting for the
operational constraints of existing plants (i.e., ramp rates or minimum run rates). Under this
paradigm, the fossil assets effectively become capacity resources which only operate when
renewable generation is insufficient to meet demand or during extreme situations such as
severe weather or contingency events, when grid reliability is paramount. Significant savings can
also be realized by power plant owners through prioritizing renewable generation during solar
and wind hours while maintaining fossil capacity for periods when renewables are not
generating.

of local solar and wind compared to the variable cost (fuel cost plus variable O&M) of existing fossil power plants,
both in 2024 and 2030. Crossover occurs when the local RE LCOE is lower than the unit-level variable cost of
existing fossil power plants. (e-f) The cumulative interconnection capacity of existing fossil power plants that is
crossed over as a function of year for both solar and wind.
Finding #3: Around 1000 GW of solar and wind is economically viable by 2030 for integration
into existing fossil interconnection
We next optimize the capacity of solar and wind that is not only economically viable, but also
technically viable for potential integration at each existing fossil plant. To do so, we take
hyperlocal hourly annual solar and wind profiles at each existing fossil plant and maximize
annual RE generation (solar + wind ) subject to constraints including an interconnection capacity
limit (to ensure that instantaneous RE generation does not exceed the existing interconnection
capacity) and an annual curtailment that is no higher than 5% (to maintain economic viability).
We additionally exclude the plant if built-up area exceeds 30% of the area within the 10x10 km
buffer zone around the plant, as this indicates significant cost implications and potential
challenges in land acquisition for RE development. The local RE resource quality is
benchmarked against actual projects under development in the vicinity; while solar resources
are generally comparable, for wind we apply an exclusion criterion to only consider local wind
potential with a minimum capacity factor of 30%. This ensures that integrating RE projects near
existing fossil power plants would not compromise on quality nor cost compared to integrating
RE with new grid interconnection. In addition to these technical and economic constraints, wind
development is excluded in counties with existing wind development moratoriums.
The RE potential that is simultaneously technically and economically viable comprises the 836
GW of actionable RE potential near the interconnection of existing fossil power plants today,
which increases to 977 GW by 2030 as the costs of new RE decline. If integrated, this actionable
RE potential could nearly double the US generation capacity. The evolution of the actionable RE
integration between 2024-2030 can be viewed by ISO/RTO in Figure 6, highlighting significant
opportunity in PJM and MISO. The opportunity in PJM is particularly acute given their significant
challenges in maintaining resource adequacy due to surging electricity demand that is
indicating a growing risk of a multi-GW capacity shortfall over the next 5 to 10 years. This
underscores the potential of interconnection sharing both with existing fossil assets as well as at
the site of retiring facilities as well, to help accelerate the integration of new resources, meet
projected load growth and support grid reliability.
Figure 6: Substantial opportunity for integrating RE at existing interconnection exists in PJM and MISO, followed
by ERCOT, SPP and FRCC.
Deploying this actionable RE potential in its entirety would require an unprecedented effort that
is currently hindered by many practical barriers - including the siting and permitting of RE
projects, equipment procurement, the availability of labor for installation, financing, etc. - which
require individual attention to substantially accelerate the RE deployment rate. Another
outstanding question regarding realistic integration of the actionable RE potential pertains to
the breakdown by type of RE, and specifically, the actionable capacity of solar versus wind.
Within the past five years, the annual capacity addition of onshore wind has averaged 10
GW/year, while solar has averaged nearly double that at 18 GW/year. Further, the magnitude of
annual capacity additions have been trending downwards for onshore wind, while solar has
been trending upwards, reflecting solar’s relatively lower complexity with regards to siting,
permitting and installation logistics over wind.
Given these deployment trends and the significant role of fuel prices in determining economic
viability, we examine two key scenarios: one considering both solar and wind integration
potential, and another focused solely on solar deployment. We analyze these scenarios across a
range of state-specific fuel prices to understand how price volatility affects integration potential
over time.
Sensitivity Analysis
To assess the robustness of our findings, we conducted sensitivity analyses using state-specific
historical fuel price volatility. For each state, we established three scenarios based on 7-year fuel
price data: a base case using the state's average price, and low and high cases set at one
standard deviation below and above that state's mean. Natural gas prices in the base case
ranged from $2.41 to $7.54/MMBtu (mean: $4.26/MMBtu), with the low scenario ranging from
$1.02 to $6.75/MMBtu (mean: $2.40/MMBtu) and the high scenario from $3.74 to
$10.00/MMBtu (mean: $6.11/MMBtu). Similarly for coal, base case prices varied from $1.25 to
$8.07/MMBtu (mean: $2.56/MMBtu), with the low scenario ranging from $1.20 to
$5.45/MMBtu (mean: $2.15/MMBtu) and the high scenario from $1.31 to $10.70/MMBtu
(mean: $2.98/MMBtu).
As shown in Figure 7, while state-level fuel price variations significantly influence the total RE
integration potential, the opportunity remains substantial across all scenarios. In 2024, the
integration potential ranges from 564 GW in the low fuel price case to 932 GW in the high fuel
price case, with the base case at 837 GW. This range evolves to 681-979 GW by 2027, with base
case at 921 GW and reaches 829-990 GW by 2030, with base case at 977 GW. Notably, the
minimum potential grows consistently across years—from 564 GW to 829 GW—demonstrating
that even in states with persistently low fuel prices, declining renewable costs drive increasing
economic viability of RE integration.
This state-level sensitivity analysis reinforces the fundamental strength of leveraging existing
interconnection for renewable integration. Even in states with consistently low fuel prices, the
potential for over 800 GW of RE capacity integration by 2030 represents a transformative
opportunity. The convergence of integration potential across scenarios over time, illustrated in
the Figure 7, underscores how declining renewable costs progressively reduce the impact of
state-level fuel price volatility on the economic case for RE integration. The narrowing range
between scenarios—from 368 GW in 2024 to 161 GW in 2030—further demonstrates the
increasing robustness of the RE integration opportunity as technology costs decline.
Figure 7: Total renewable energy integration potential across different fuel price scenarios (2024-2030). The
range between high and low scenarios narrows from 368 GW in 2024 to 161 GW in 2030, demonstrating increasing
resilience to fuel price variations.
To more closely align with current renewable deployment trends, we conduct a Solar-Only
Scenario (SOS) analysis, reflecting the generally lower siting and permitting barriers faced by
solar projects compared to wind. As seen in Figure 8, in the SOS base case, the integration
potential begins at 499 GW in 2024, grows to 614 GW by 2027, and reaches 693 GW by 2030.
The potential shows significant sensitivity to fuel price variations, particularly in earlier years.
Under high fuel prices (one standard deviation above state means), the potential increases to
608 GW in 2024, 681 GW in 2027, and 700 GW in 2030. Conversely, with low fuel prices (one
standard deviation below state means), the potential starts at 281 GW in 2024, rises to 384 GW
by 2027, and reaches 567 GW by 2030.
The impact of fuel price variations on solar integration potential demonstrates a clear pattern of
convergence over time, as also shown in Figure 8. The potential range is widest in 2024,
spanning 327 GW (from 281 GW to 608 GW), but narrows substantially to 297 GW by 2027
(from 384 GW to 681 GW) and further contracts to 134 GW by 2030 (from 567 GW to 700 GW).
This convergence pattern mirrors our findings from the combined solar and wind analysis,
suggesting that while near-term solar deployment opportunities are significantly influenced by
fuel price fluctuations, the long-term integration potential becomes increasingly robust as solar
costs continue to decline. Even in the most conservative scenario with persistently low fuel
prices, the potential for solar integration reaches 567 GW by 2030, representing a substantial
opportunity for clean energy deployment.
Figure 8: Solar-only integration potential across different fuel price scenarios (2024-2030). Similar to total RE, the
range between scenarios contracts from 327 GW in 2024 to 134 GW in 2030, showing increasing economic viability
over time.
Interconnection Cost Savings
Utilizing existing interconnection has the added benefit of avoiding much of the costs of
interconnection, including network upgrades. These costs have grown substantially in recent
years, ranging from $71-107/kW by ISO (19). This indicates that integrating the identified 1134
GW of renewable capacity at existing interconnection by 2030 could avoid approximately $85
billion in interconnection costs compared to developing these projects at new interconnection
points. These savings stem from both minimizing direct interconnection infrastructure
investments and avoiding network upgrades by leveraging the existing system, representing a
significant reduction in system costs.
Operational feasibility
To assess the operational feasibility of integrating RE capacity at existing interconnection and
account for operational constraints of existing plants (i.e., ramp rates or minimum run rates), we
conduct a detailed hourly dispatch simulation for an exemplary CCGT, California's La Paloma
Plant (1048 MW), with an additional 1048 MWAC of solar capacity at the same interconnection
point. The combined solar and gas system was modeled to deliver flat block power daily, i.e. the
most rigorous ramping and unit commitment scenario, requiring the CCGT plant to cycle each
day within operational constraints that are aligned with CAISO’s model parameters. The analysis
indicates that integrating solar capacity alongside the CCGT at the existing interconnection point
is technically feasible and fully adheres to operational constraints - including ramping, technical
minimum levels, and minimum up and down times - and maintains solar curtailment at only
~5%. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate the long-term impacts of daily cycling on
CCGT equipment durability.
Finding #4: Leveraging existing interconnection can help deliver a least-cost power system in
over 35 states
Although around 1000 GW of actionable RE integration is assessed on a hyperlocal plant-level,
from a broader system perspective, the RE required for a least-cost system is likely to differ. To
evaluate this, we utilize a widely-used high-resolution transmission and generation capacity
expansion model, the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) (20). The model optimizes
the least-cost generation mix that meets the projected electricity demand for each of the
model’s 134 zones in the contiguous US, accounting for current policy such as IRA incentives as
well as future technology cost declines. We compare the resulting least-cost renewable capacity
needs by 2030 with our estimated interconnection sharing potential at the state level in order
to ensure our estimates align with least-cost system needs while simultaneously identifying
states where interconnection sharing could significantly contribute to meeting renewable
deployment targets. Where actionable RE through interconnection sharing exceeds the
least-cost requirement for a state, we constrain it to that requirement; while in states where our
estimated potential falls below the least-cost requirement, we maintain our original estimate as
it represents the realistic ceiling for interconnection sharing in that region. After applying these
adjustments across all states, our analysis indicates that by 2030, interconnection sharing could
enable the economical integration of 775 GW of renewables, helping to deliver the majority of
RE needs for a least-cost power system in 38 states as shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9: Leveraging the interconnection of existing fossil power plants can help deliver a least-cost power
system in a majority of states. (a) Percentage showing the proportion of interconnection sharing in meeting the
state’s RE needs for a least-cost system in 2030. (b) State-by-state breakdown of actionable RE versus the RE needs.
Finding #5: More than 200 GW of existing fossil capacity in the US is minimally utilized and
has high operating costs
The greatest immediate opportunity for interconnection sharing lies with existing fossil power
plants that are either or both expensive to operate (with high variable costs) or minimally
utilized (with low capacity factors). For instance, in 2023, over 200 GW of US fossil capacity did
not use their interconnection for over 85% of hours in the year. The majority of this fossil
capacity consists of peaker plants, run only to meet periods of peak residual demand. These
peaker plants are typically natural gas-fired combustion turbines (CTs) as well as oil and gas
steam turbines (STs) with higher heat rates and thus lower efficiencies compared to baseload
fossil generation, namely natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs). Simultaneously,
the vast majority of this minimally-utilized 200 GW of fossil capacity has operating costs that
average approximately $20/MWh higher than intermediate and baseload fossil capacity that
runs at higher capacity factors, as seen in Figure 10. On an aggregate level, the utilization of
fossil power plants and their interconnection capacity would decrease as the RE penetration in
the system grows.
Figure 10: More than 200 GW of fossil capacity has a capacity factor below 15% and faces operating costs higher
than the cost of new RE. The supply curve shows the capacity factor versus the cumulative installed capacity of US
fossil plants, overlaid with the plants’ operating costs from 2023 (composed of variable O&M plus fuel costs).
The high operating costs of these plants are in part due to, and further exacerbated by, their
age. Coal-fired plants in the US average over 43 years, while oil-fired units average 42 years -
which is likely beyond, or at least approaching, the lifespan of their original design specifications
(21). This aging infrastructure not only contributes to operational inefficiencies at these plants,
with older units requiring more fuel input per unit of electricity generated, but also
monopolizes increasingly valuable interconnection points at a time when new renewable
generators face significant challenges securing timely grid access. This presents an opportunity
to improve the utilization of existing grid infrastructure through interconnection sharing,
supporting the efficient integration of low-cost clean energy sources while maintaining the
reliability services provided by existing generators.
Discussion
The technically feasible and economically viable opportunity for low-cost solar and wind to
share interconnection with existing fossil plants totals around 1000 GW by 2030, with the
potential to nearly double US generation capacity. This strategy benefits all stakeholders
involved, as seen in Figure 11. First, it helps to rapidly deliver clean and low-cost electricity for
consumers and the economy. From a power system perspective, integrating additional RE while
retaining conventional fossil assets ensures the availability of sufficient generation capacity to
serve rapid load growth, supporting grid reliability. The strategy diversifies the portfolios and
revenue streams of power plant owners, creating net savings when lower-cost RE is used
instead of conventional fossil generation during RE generation hours. RE developers meanwhile
benefit from faster project realization, IRA incentives, and lower infrastructure costs due to
avoided expenditure on interconnection equipment such as breakers and transformers. Further,
it generates substantial investment and reduced pollution in energy communities, generating
local tax revenue and providing employment opportunities to those who may otherwise
experience a progressive decline as conventional fossil-fuel fired assets are scaled back.
Figure 11: Interconnection sharing provides several benefits across various stakeholders.
Policy recommendations to accelerate RE deployment at existing interconnection
Although FERC Order 845 paves the way for capitalizing on the benefits of surplus
interconnection, additional policy and regulatory support is required for this to become a
mainstream strategy for integrating clean electricity sources at speed and scale. This is because
surplus interconnection presents a significant opportunity, but also a significant deviation from
the conventional interconnection process. While the interconnection process has notably been
subject to substantial reform in recent years, the basic process involves an interconnection
customer - i.e., a RE project developer - submitting a request for grid interconnection to the
transmission provider, joining the queue of interested projects. These projects must undergo a
series of system impact and facility studies that analyze if, and which, network upgrades are
needed before the project can be brought online. The costs of these impact studies, as well as
the identified network upgrades, are borne by the interconnection customer. In recent years,
the number of projects in the queue has ballooned for a number of reasons: more distributed
energy projects joining the queue, growing interest in developing RE with the support of tax
credits, and an outdated process that has not kept pace with new requests. Yet if a project
manages to successfully pass through, the interconnection customer signs an interconnection
agreement with the transmission provider that stipulates terms of operation. In contrast, an
interconnection customer interested in interconnection at an existing point of interconnection
would follow a very different process.
Background on FERC Order 845
Issued April 2018, Section IV.C.3 of FERC Order 845 requires transmission providers to establish an
expedited process for interconnection customers to utilize or transfer Surplus Interconnection Service
(SIS) at existing generating facilities such that the total amount of interconnection service (and thus
the combined generating output) at the Point of Interconnection (POI) remains the same and no
network upgrades are required (22). While the existing interconnection customer or its affiliates has
the priority to use SIS, it may be transferred to another interconnection customer. The required studies
for SIS include reactive power, short circuit/fault duty, stability analyses, and potentially steady-state
(thermal/voltage) analyses as necessary. Nearly all regions of the US comply with Order 845’s
requirements with the exceptions of ERCOT (which is not under the jurisdiction of FERC) and NYISO
(which sought and was granted an independent entity variation), albeit with varied implementation.
Generally, the SIS process significantly shortens the interconnection timeline (versus the recent
average of 4-5 years for projects requiring new interconnection). However, surplus interconnection is,
by definition, tied to the continued existence of the original interconnection customer’s
interconnection service; meanwhile, the process for adding new generation at retiring plant sites,
referred to as the “generator replacement service,” varies widely by region.
Today, there are 3 main barriers which hinder the full realization of this actionable potential: (1)
limited awareness and/or motivation to capitalize on the large availability of economically viable
RE potential near existing fossil power plants, particularly for the existing interconnection rights
holders, (2) existing integrated resource and transmission planning processes do not consider
RE deployment at existing interconnection, and (3) existing grid interconnection rules provide
limited or insufficient support for interconnection sharing.
To address these barriers, policy recommendations for key entities include:
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC):
● Streamline Surplus Interconnection Service: Ensure a consistent surplus interconnection
service framework, removing overly restrictive study assumptions, improving process
functionality and including a streamlined procedure for SIS customers to be able to
permanently retain interconnection rights following the retirement of the original
interconnection customer.
● Harmonize Generator Replacement Rules: Ensure a consistent generator replacement
framework across all regions that enables fast-tracking of new energy projects at the site
of retiring facilities, for example based on MISO’s existing model.
● Create Standardized Agreements: Consider requiring transmission operators to develop
and implement pro-forma agreements (e.g., Monitoring and Consent, Conversion) to
clarify and expedite interconnection transactions, reducing administrative complexities
across RTOs.
● Efficiently allocate existing interconnection rights to lower costs and protect consumer
interests. Develop a regulatory pathway to fairly compensate current rights holders
while establishing a system for efficient grid access allocation that promotes improved
utilization, cost reduction, and competition.
● Enhance Transparency: Introduce open processes to transfer interconnection rights and
prevent capacity hoarding, considering the creation of a clearinghouse, addressing
concerns over “capacity squatting” and enabling fair access to interconnection capacity.
ISOs/RTOs:
● Streamline Surplus Interconnection Service: Ensure a consistent surplus interconnection
service framework, removing overly restrictive study assumptions, improving process
functionality and including a streamlined procedure for SIS customers to be able to
retain interconnection rights following the retirement of the original interconnection
customer.
● Enhance Generator Replacement Rules: Ensure a consistent generator replacement
framework compatible with neighboring regions that enables fast-tracking of new
energy projects at the site of retiring facilities, for example based on MISO’s existing
model; ensure this is harmonized to allow for continuation of interconnection service for
SIS customers following the retirement of the original interconnection customer.
● Integrate SIS and generator replacement in long-term transmission planning: Consider
renewable resources at existing interconnection points in the scenario planning under
Order 1920.
● Enhance Transparency: Establish data portals and/or perform studies that highlight
surplus interconnection opportunities to guide developers and load-serving entities
(LSEs) in project planning.
● Facilitate Adoption: Consider developing a clearinghouse to enable market participants
to offer surplus interconnection capacity to others, facilitating bilateral agreements.
● Standardize Contractual Agreements with Interconnection Customers: Consider
developing standardized contractual agreements to establish the terms of operation of
shared interconnection, particularly with surplus interconnection customers.
Public Utility Commissions (PUCs):
● Integrate SIS in IRPs and RFPs: Require utilities to include surplus interconnection and
generation replacement capacity options in Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) and
Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to prioritize cost-effective renewable deployment that can
leverage existing infrastructure.
● Assess Existing Interconnection Potential: Direct utilities to study clean energy potential
at existing fossil power plants, promoting rapid RE deployment and cost savings by
avoiding additional interconnection and transmission expenses.
State Legislators:
● Mandate SIS and Generator Replacement in Planning: Pass legislation requiring that
PUCs assess surplus interconnection and generation replacement capacity as part of
generation planning processes, improving grid resilience and accelerating renewable
deployment for consumer benefit.
● Address Siting and Workforce Development: Allocate funding to communities with fossil
infrastructure to conduct studies on local siting as well as the economic, environmental,
and community benefits of utilizing existing interconnection, and support workforce
reskilling programs to transition labor from retiring plants to new clean energy roles.
Load-Serving Entities (LSEs):
● Prioritize Existing Interconnection in Resource Planning: Assess surplus interconnection
and generation replacement capacity opportunities in resource planning and RPS
compliance, focusing on renewable development at existing interconnection points to
minimize infrastructure costs and increase speed of interconnection.
● Conduct Cost-Savings Studies: Analyze and communicate potential savings from
integrating renewable energy at existing sites, demonstrating reduced costs through
avoided interconnection and transmission needs.
● Partner with Legacy Generators: Collaborate with legacy generators to co-develop
renewable and storage projects at existing interconnection, using shared
interconnection agreements to share benefits and meet clean energy goals effectively.
Generators with Interconnection Rights:
● Monetize Interconnection Capacity: Explore opportunities to monetize unused
interconnection capacity, either through direct sale or auction, thereby creating new
revenue streams and supporting renewable deployment.
● Partner with Renewable Developers: Develop partnerships with renewable energy and
storage developers to utilize surplus interconnection rights, providing access to existing
infrastructure while supporting grid reliability and clean energy growth.
Future work
Exploring the Potential of an Integrated Renewable, Repower (Surplus Interconnection), and
Reconductoring (RRR) Strategy for Rapid and Extensive Deployment of Low-Cost Electricity
There can be several possible extensions of this work. First, evaluating the additional storage
and renewable energy (RE) deployment potential by sharing grid access with existing RE plants,
which currently have a capacity of about 250 GW. There is potential to add 4-6 hours of storage
at a similar capacity (250 GW), thereby adding significant new firm capacity to the U.S. grid
while creating opportunities for an additional 250-500 GW of RE deployment that can share the
same interconnection. Several RE projects are already adopting such strategies.
The US has one of the world's largest transmission networks, with over 600,000 miles of
high-voltage transmission lines crisscrossing the country, and vast amounts of economical RE
potential exist in the vicinity of these lines. However, in 2023, the country added only around 60
miles of new high-voltage transmission lines, contributing to a five-year total of just 2,500-3,000
miles. The grid primarily uses wires based on technology that is more than 100 years old. Our
research has shown that the U.S. can double its transmission capacity and meet over 80% of its
transmission needs by rewiring the grid with commercially available advanced conductors (i.e.,
reconductoring), which can carry twice the amount of electricity. This upgrade can be
completed much faster and more economically than building brand-new lines, bypassing the
lengthy permitting processes required for new infrastructure.
With reconductoring, which can potentially double grid capacity, the interconnection capacity of
the existing power generation infrastructure (exceeding 1,000 GW) can be significantly
increased (up to a doubling). This would enable more interconnections, leveraging existing
infrastructure while reducing costs and timelines. Thus, combining a focus on renewables,
re-powering (surplus interconnection), and a reconductoring strategy can pave the way for
low-cost, clean energy abundance.
Methods and Data Summary
In order to estimate the technical feasible and economically viable RE integration potential by
sharing grid access with existing fossil plants we used the following steps.
First, we estimated the renewable energy resource availability within the vicinity (within a
6-mile buffer zone around each power plant) that could share the existing grid access. In
assessing RE availability, we considered over 50+ criterias to replicate the exclusion criteria
typically used by developers, including physical constraints, environmental protections, local
ordinances limiting RE deployment, and difficulty of deploying RE near urban areas. Even after
applying these considerations, we found that over 80% of the fossil power plants have more
than five times the renewable potential compared to their current interconnection capacity
limits
The second step was to evaluate the economic viability of RE sharing grid access with existing
fossil plants. We identified plants where the LCOE of local renewables is lower than the
operating costs (fuel costs and variable o&m costs) of fossil plants. In such cases, it would be
economically beneficial for these plants to allow renewables to access the grid, as this would
enable them to save costs by prioritizing renewable generation over fossil-based electricity
when available. This analysis involved collecting detailed data on the operating costs of over
1,400 power plants and estimating the local LCOE for renewables near each of these plants. We
also considered all the applicable tax incentives and savings in interconnection costs that arise
from using the same interconnection.
The third step was to estimate for plants where the LCOE of local RE is lower than the operating
costs of power plants, how much renewable energy can be integrated to maximize the use of
existing interconnection while considering its current limit. For each of the plant locations, we
estimated the optimal portfolio of solar wind which maximizes interconnection usage (solar +
wind generation) while limiting the curtailment to below 5%. We conducted a dispatch
simulation for a power plant using actual operating constraints and confirmed that technical
operational limitations did not increase curtailment beyond the 5% threshold.
The fourth step was to determine what share of the total renewable capacity needed in the
future, based on a least-cost planning exercise, could be met through deployment at existing
interconnections. To do this, we conducted a national generation capacity expansion study using
NREL's ReEDS model, which simulates 134 sub-regions in the U.S., to identify the least-cost
capacity mix of solar and wind. We then compared how much of this projected capacity could
be met through deployment at existing interconnections.
The following discussion offers more details on each of these steps.
1. Estimating Local Renewable Resource Availability
Estimating Local Renewable Energy Potential
To assess the solar and wind potential near existing fossil power plants, we conduct a geospatial
analysis integrating multiple high-resolution datasets. For each plant, we define a 6x6 mile
(10x10 km) square buffer zone, representing the area within which RE projects could feasibly
connect to existing interconnection infrastructure. We create a comprehensive exclusion
dataset to exclude unsuitable areas for RE development, integrating land cover, protected areas,
elevation, and slope data. Key data sources include:
● Protected Areas: US Geological Survey's Protected Areas Database (PAD-US) to exclude
national parks, wildlife refuges, and other conserved lands (23).
● Elevation and Slope: Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (30 m resolution) to exclude
areas with high slopes and elevation (24).
● Land Cover: European Space Agency's WorldCover 10 m dataset to exclude urban areas,
water bodies, wetlands, dense forests, etc. (25).
For the remaining suitable areas within each buffer zone, we estimate potential solar and wind
energy capacities using standard conversion factors: 50 MW per square kilometer for solar PV
and 6 MW per square kilometer for wind. These factors reflect typical utility-scale installation
densities and provide an estimate of the maximum buildable RE capacity near each fossil plant.
2. Evaluating the Economic Viability of Renewable Energy Sharing Grid Access
Estimating power plant operating costs
We develop a detailed dataset of existing fossil power plants in the US using data from the US
Energy Information Administration (EIA) Forms 860 and 923 for the year 2023 and 2022 (26,27).
This dataset includes information on plant location, capacity, fuel type, operational
characteristics, heat rates, and variable operating costs. To enhance accuracy, especially for heat
rates, we incorporate cleaned data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL)
Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) database, which provides validated engineering
assessments based on actual performance data (20). Fuel price data were collected from
multiple EIA sources. For natural gas, we took the recent 7-year average incorporating
state-level monthly natural gas prices for electric power (supplemented with monthly state-level
citygate prices if not available) (28). As oil & gas steam turbines are either mostly gas-based or
dual-use technologies, their fuel costs are similarly based on natural gas prices. For coal, we
used the recent 7-year average incorporating quarterly prices based on coal shipments to the
electric power sector by plant state (29). Ownership structures were established using the
Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP),
supplemented by EIA Form 860 data (26,30).
Estimate local LCOE of RE
We estimate hourly solar and wind generation profiles at each plant location using
high-resolution meteorological data and a custom software tool developed for this study.
● Custom Simulation Tool: We developed a custom software tool that integrates
established models (PySAM, PVWatts) with detailed system specifications to provide
accurate hourly generation profiles for each site.
● Solar Generation:
○ Data Sources: We utilize the ERA5 dataset from the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), providing hourly data on solar
irradiance, air temperature, pressure and wind speed at approximately 31 km
resolution (31).
○ Simulation: We calculated three key solar irradiance measurements (Global
Horizontal, Direct Normal, and Diffuse Horizontal) to model solar power
generation. Using these measurements, we simulated the hourly output of a 1
MW solar farm equipped with single-axis tracking through the PVWatts model.
To ensure accurate results, our simulation incorporated various technical
parameters including the panels' tilt angles, directional orientation, system
efficiency losses, and tracking system dynamics (32).
● Wind Generation:
○ Data Sources: We utilize NASA's MERRA-2 dataset for wind speed, direction,
pressure and temperature at various altitudes (33).
○ Simulation: We employ the Python-based System Advisor Model (PySAM) to
simulate wind power generation (34). The wind farm model simulates a detailed
layout of 8 rows by 4, totaling 32 turbines, and accounts for wake effects and
turbine interactions. Wind speeds are extrapolated to turbine hub heights,
adjusted for local terrain and atmospheric conditions using high spatial
resolution data from Global Wind Atlas.
These hourly generation profiles allowed us to estimate capacity factors for solar and wind at
each plant location, accounting for temporal and spatial variations in resource quality.
Using the estimated capacity factors and cost parameters, we estimate the LCOE for solar and
wind projects near each existing fossil power plant. Our cost and financial data were sourced
from reputable industry and governmental reports to ensure accuracy:
● Cost Data:
○ Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditures (OPEX) come from
NREL's Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) 2024 (13).
● Financial Parameters:
○ Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is calculated based on typical industry
debt-to-equity ratios and costs of capital, from NREL's ATB 2024 (13).
○ Project Lifespan is assumed to be 30 years for both wind projects and solar PV
projects, from NREL's ATB 2024 (13).
● Regional Adjustments:
○ Capital Cost Multipliers are applied to account for regional variations in
installation costs, using data from the US EIA regional cost factors and NREL's
ReEDS model (20).
● Incentives:
○ We account for federal and state incentives including the Investment Tax Credit
(ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) as outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act
(IRA) of 2022 (12). These incentives were applied according to eligibility criteria
and phase-out schedules.
○ We incorporate energy community designations to account for additional
incentives available under the IRA. Energy communities are areas that have been
economically affected by the decline of fossil fuel industries and are eligible for
bonus tax credits to encourage renewable energy development. We identify
these areas using data from the National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL)
Energy Communities interactive map and the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS)
Notice 2023-29 (35,36). This information was integrated into our dataset to
adjust the LCOEof solar and wind for plants located within these designated
areas.
We compare the estimated LCOE with the variable operating costs of individual units of the
corresponding fossil plant, derived from fuel price data and heat rate metrics from EIA Forms
860, 923 and ReEDS. If the LCOE was lower than the plant's variable costs, we considered the
plant to have "crossed over," indicating a cost-effective opportunity for replacing fossil
generation with renewable energy. This analysis was conducted annually from 2024 through
2030 to capture changes in technology costs, fuel prices, and policy incentives over time.
Interconnection Cost Savings
To quantify potential cost savings from utilizing existing interconnection infrastructure, we
analyze historical interconnection queue data from LBNL for completed projects from 2018
onwards across four Independent System Operators (ISOs): ISO-NE, MISO, PJM, and SPP (19).
For each ISO, we calculate capacity-weighted average interconnection costs using only projects
that achieved commercial operation, finding costs ranged from $71/kW in SPP to $107/kW in
ISO-NE, with PJM at $83/kW and MISO at $85/kW. For regions outside these ISOs, we applied
the mean interconnection cost from analyzed regions as a representative value.
The interconnection costs we analyze comprise two major components that could be largely
avoided through co-location with existing fossil plants. The first component is Point of
Interconnection (POI) costs - the direct expenses associated with physically connecting to the
grid, including construction of interconnection substations and transmission line extensions
(spurlines). The second component is network upgrade costs - the broader system-wide
upgrades required to accommodate new generation, often involving reconstruction of
transmission lines and substantial grid modifications.
Our interconnection cost estimates were based on projects that successfully reached
commercial operation, as these represent the most realistic cost benchmarks. We excluded
withdrawn projects from cost calculations, though notably these projects often faced
significantly higher projected interconnection costs - frequently 2-3 times higher than
completed projects - which likely contributed to their withdrawal. This conservative approach of
using only completed project costs provides a lower-bound estimate of potential savings.
3. Estimating Renewable Energy Integration Potential to Maximize Use of Existing
Interconnection Capacity
To determine the realistic integration potential of RE at existing interconnection points, we
develop optimization models that maximize interconnection utilization while limiting
curtailment and adhering to interconnection capacity limits. The model is formulated as follows:
Objective:
With the following decision variables:
● Installed solar capacity:
● Installed wind capacity:
Subject to the following constraints:
● Interconnection Capacity Limit, ensures that generation does not exceed the plant's
maximum interconnection capacity
● Curtailment Limit, limiting annual curtailment to 5% of total potential generation to
maintain economic viability:
● Curtailment Calculation, where and are the hourly capacity factors for
solar and wind, respectively:
For plants where wind energy was viable (capacity factors above a threshold of 30%, consistent
with current projects), we optimize both solar and wind capacities. For others, we optimize
solar capacity alone. The optimization was performed using hourly data over a full year for each
plant, processing in parallel batches to manage computational demands.
Actionable RE integration potential
The actionable RE integration was then estimated based on the RE potential that was both
technically- and economically-viable: for each unit for which crossover has occurred, the
plant-level technically-viable RE is adjusted by the proportion of the unit’s capacity to the plant’s
total capacity.
4. Determining the Share of Total Least-Cost Renewable Capacity that Can Be Met by
Deployment at Existing Interconnections
To align the actionable RE integration with actual power system needs, we conduct a
comparative analysis using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Regional Energy
Deployment System (ReEDS) model (20). ReEDS is widely used by the US Department of Energy
and is considered an industry standard for projecting the optimal mix of generation
technologies required to meet future electricity demand. By running ReEDS up to 2030, we
obtain projections of the new capacity needed by technology—such as solar, wind, and gas—to
meet the 2030 load, considering current US policies and hourly load profiles. We aggregate the
ReEDS-projected new capacity installations of RE (solar and wind) at the state-level and similarly
aggregate our estimated actionable RE integration potential from installing solar and wind near
existing interconnections. This comparison allows us to determine the percentage of the
required renewable capacity in each state that could be met by integrating solar and wind near
existing fossil plant interconnections. To ensure consistency with regional planning needs, we
adjust the actionable integration by capping it at the ReEDS-projected least-cost capacity
portfolio for each state. If our integration potential exceeded the ReEDS estimate for a state, we
limited it to the ReEDS requirement; if it was lower, we retained our original estimate.
