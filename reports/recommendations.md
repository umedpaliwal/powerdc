## Hero Headline

* **Option 1:** Fast-Track Your Data Center – Go Live in 18 Months, Not 5 Years
* **Option 2:** Build Your Data Center 3–4 Years Faster (Go Live in 18 Months)
* **Option 3:** Accelerate AI-Ready Data Centers – Deploy in 18 Months, Not 5 Years

## Subheadline

* **Option 1:** Leverage 1,000 GW of idle grid capacity to deploy now – skip the new-connection queue entirely.
* **Option 2:** Tap into existing power plant connections to bypass the years-long grid queue. Get your project online in months, not years.
* **Option 3:** Use Surplus Interconnection (FERC Order 845) to sidestep the 5-year wait. Unlock ready-to-use grid capacity for your project now.

## Problem Section (AI Infrastructure Bottleneck)

* **Option 1:** **The Gridlock Holding Back AI** – The power grid can’t keep up with AI’s explosive growth. New data centers face multi-year delays just to get connected.
* **Option 2:** **AI’s Unmet Power Demand** – AI’s energy needs are skyrocketing, but grid connections can’t keep up. New data centers sit in queue for years while demand surges.
* **Option 3:** **The 5-Year Data Center Bottleneck** – Building new data centers is now an uphill battle. Many projects are stuck waiting 5+ years just to gain grid access.

## Surplus Interconnection Explanation

* **Option 1:** Launch sustainable data centers in as little as 1–2 years by tapping idle grid capacity at existing power plants.
* **Option 2:** With Surplus Interconnection, you bypass building new grid connections. Instead, use underused capacity at an existing plant to power a 95% renewable data center in just 1–2 years.
* **Option 3:** Use surplus capacity at idle power plants to fast-track new data centers. This approach delivers 95% clean energy with 99.99% uptime in just 1–2 years.

## Benefits Section (Key Benefits)

## Timeline Comparison

* **Option 1:**

  * **Traditional Interconnection:** New grid connection requiring full studies (5–6 years)
  * **Surplus Interconnection:** Use an existing site’s capacity (1–2 years)
  * *Result:* Launch AI infrastructure 3–4 years sooner.

* **Option 2:**

  * **Traditional Interconnection:** Build new grid infrastructure from scratch (5–6 years)
  * **Surplus Interconnection:** Leverage an idle power plant connection (1–2 years)
  * *Result:* Go live 3–4 years faster with the surplus approach.

* **Option 3:**

  * **Traditional Interconnection:** Wait for new grid capacity and lengthy approvals (5–6 years)
  * **Surplus Interconnection:** Tap existing grid capacity already in place (1–2 years)
  * *Result:* Save 3–4 years on your timeline by using Surplus Interconnection.
