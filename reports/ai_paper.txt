Data center electricity demand is projected to grow dramatically, largely driven by the increasing power
requirements of AI. A recent study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Shehabi et al. LBNL
2024) estimates that this demand will grow to between 74 GW and 132 GW by 2028, up from the
current level of approximately 40 GW. This annual energy use is projected to account for 6.7% to 12.0%
of total U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. Other studies provide similar estimates for 2030:
Goldman Sachs (8%), The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) high scenario (9.1%), and
McKinsey (12%) of the nation’s power.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, highlighted the immense energy demands of AI technologies, stating, “We
still don’t appreciate the energy needs of this technology… there’s no way to get there without a
breakthrough… we need fusion or radically cheaper solar plus storage, or something.” Mark Zuckerberg,
CEO of Meta, shared similar concerns, noting that the company would expand its data centers if more
electricity were available. Echoing these views, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and X.ai, predicted an
escalating strain on resources, warning of “a silicon shortage today, a transformer shortage in about a year,
and electricity shortages in about two years.
Current strategies, which often involve reallocating grid resources from existing consumers—such as
using nuclear plants to power AI workloads—have severe scalability limitations and are already
encountering challenges. Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), while promising for the long term, are
unlikely to be deployed at scale before 2035.

Our recent research (see Paliwal et al., 2024) shows that more than 80% of the 1,400+ coal and gas
plants in the US have over five times the economical solar deployment capacity in their vicinity
(within a 10 km by 10 km buffer zone) compared to their current capacity. This is primarily due to the
recent dramatic decline in renewable energy (RE) costs, further amplified by incentives from the
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The total local RE potential near these power plants, after applying
several exclusion criteria, exceeds 15,000 GW.
Additionally, we find that approximately 100 GW of gas power plant capacity is utilized less than 5%
of the time (see Figure 5 below), making it a viable source of backup generation capacity for 24/7 solar +
storage plants that could be deployed near these locations.

Figure 5: More than 200 GW of fossil capacity has a capacity factor below 15% and faces operating
costs higher than the cost of new RE. The supply curve shows the capacity factor versus the cumulative
installed capacity of US fossil plants, overlaid with the plants’ operating costs from 2023 (composed of
variable O&M plus fuel costs).
Typically, power plants that generate electricity for only a small fraction of the year do so during periods
of high power prices, which also indicate times when the grid most urgently needs them.
Furthermore, as we demonstrate in Figure 6, at least in the case of ERCOT, the times when the project
would require gas generation backup tend not to overlap with periods of high prices and power scarcity.
In ERCOT, higher prices—and thus the use of expensive gas generators—are typically observed during
summer afternoon and evening peaks, a period when the solar + storage hybrid plant does not require gas
backup. However, this observation needs to be evaluated in more depth and across other markets.
