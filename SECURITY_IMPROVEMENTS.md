# Security Improvements Implemented

## Date: 2025-08-07

This document outlines the security improvements that have been implemented in the PowerDC-Web application to address vulnerabilities identified in the security audit.

## 1. Security Headers ✅

**File Modified:** `next.config.js`

Added comprehensive security headers including:
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional XSS protection for older browsers
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information sent with requests
- **Permissions-Policy**: Controls browser feature access

## 2. CSRF Protection ✅

**Files Created:**
- `lib/csrf.ts`: CSRF token generation and validation utilities
- `app/api/csrf/route.ts`: Endpoint for CSRF token generation
- `hooks/useCSRF.ts`: React hook for CSRF token management

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/user/profile/route.ts`: Added CSRF validation for PUT and POST methods
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Integrated CSRF tokens in API calls

**Features:**
- Cryptographically secure token generation
- Token validation for state-changing operations
- Automatic token refresh
- SameSite cookie protection

## 3. XSS Prevention ✅

**Files Created:**
- `lib/sanitize.ts`: HTML sanitization utilities

**Files Modified:**
- `app/components/SimpleMap.tsx`: Sanitized map popup content
- `app/components/dashboard-content.tsx`: Safe DOM content setting for popups

**Features:**
- HTML entity escaping
- Safe popup HTML generation
- URL sanitization
- Prevention of script injection

## 4. Secure Cookie Configuration ✅

**File Modified:**
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`: Enhanced cookie security settings

**Security Settings Applied:**
- `httpOnly`: Prevents JavaScript access to cookies
- `secure`: Ensures cookies only sent over HTTPS (in production)
- `sameSite: 'lax'`: CSRF protection through SameSite policy
- Proper path configuration

## 5. Rate Limiting ✅

**File Created:**
- `lib/rate-limit.ts`: Comprehensive rate limiting system

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts`: Rate limiting for payment operations
- `app/api/saved-searches/route.ts`: Rate limiting for read/write operations

**Rate Limit Configurations:**
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- API endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- Read operations: 200 requests per minute
- Write operations: 20 requests per minute
- Stripe operations: 10 requests per minute

## Testing & Verification

All changes have been tested to ensure:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Security headers are properly set
- ✅ CSRF protection is functional
- ✅ Rate limiting works as expected

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set
   - [ ] Set strong `CSRF_SECRET` environment variable
   - [ ] Verify all API keys are using production values

2. **Security Headers**
   - [ ] Test CSP policy doesn't break functionality
   - [ ] Verify all external resources are whitelisted in CSP

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - [ ] Consider using Redis for distributed rate limiting
   - [ ] Adjust rate limits based on actual usage patterns

4. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Set up alerts for rate limit violations
   - [ ] Monitor CSRF token failures
   - [ ] Track security header violations

## Additional Recommendations

While the immediate security issues have been addressed, consider these additional improvements:

1. **Implement Security Monitoring**
   - Add logging for security events
   - Set up alerting for suspicious activities
   - Implement audit trails for sensitive operations

2. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Schedule quarterly security reviews
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run automated security scans in CI/CD

3. **Security Training**
   - Ensure all developers understand OWASP Top 10
   - Regular security awareness training
   - Code review checklist for security

4. **Advanced Protections**
   - Consider implementing Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Add bot protection for public endpoints
   - Implement account lockout policies
